# Fraud Detetion System using Machine Learning.

In this project, we take the transactional credit data from kaggle to find the fraud between the transaction.

## Project Structure

```
├───data
    └───creditcard.csv
├───notebooks

    └───model.py
    └───utils.py
```

- **data** folder is exempt contains the dataset which is exempt due to its size. But, the links to the dataset will be given.
- **data_preprocessing.ipynb** handle the data cleaning, transformation and all the stuff making data ready for the models to use.
